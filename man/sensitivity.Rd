}
\arguments{
\item{metrics.df}{= data frame of metric values for each station}

\item{ref.cond}{= The site classification that represents better
environmental conditions.}

\item{deg.cond}{= The site classification that represents the degraded
environmental conditions.}

\item{method}{= the sensitivity function to be used during the assessment.}
}
\value{
Determines the threshold at which a metric best categorizes
reference and degraded stations.
